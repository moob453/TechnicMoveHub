Hey this project is slowly becoming a capable library for the technic move hub
Currently its contained in just one python file but the funtionality is built to be that of pybricks

example can be found in the main.py file and used freely
this was built on python 3.12.0 and includes a .venv folder
i havent made a dependencies folder yet and its not published with pip yet so this will have errors if you try to import and run it
currently supports the hubs main led and all colors
